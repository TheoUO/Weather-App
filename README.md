[Visit the Deployed Site](https://theouo.github.io/Weather-App/)

For this project, I create a daily planner where users can input their tasks for the day.

## Usage 

This site is quite easy to navigate through. Once you load it, you are presented with a search bar where any user can check the weather for any city in the U.S.


## Learning Points 
I got to learn more on APIs as I made use of the open weather api and I also was able to learn more through my research in the my usage of Javascript.
